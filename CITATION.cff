abstract: |
  "Scientific welding data covers a wide range of physical domains and
  timescales and are measured using various different sensors. Complex and
  highly specialized experimental setups at different welding institutes
  complicate the exchange of welding research data further.

  The WelDX research project aims to foster the exchange of scientific
  data inside the welding community by developing and establishing a new
  open source file format suitable for the documentation of experimental
  welding data and upholding associated quality standards. In addition to
  fostering scientific collaboration inside the national and international
  welding community an associated advisory committee will be established
  to oversee the future development of the file format. The proposed file
  format will be developed with regard to current needs of the community
  regarding interoperability, data quality and performance and will be
  published under an appropriate open source license. By using the file
  format objectivity, comparability and reproducibility across different
  experimental setups can be improved."
