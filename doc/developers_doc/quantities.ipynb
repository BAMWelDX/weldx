    "1. A default `pint.UnitRegistry` is created and imported as `weldx.constants.WELDX_UNIT_REGISTRY`.\n",
    "  Since all `pint` quantities must have the same base `UnitRegistry` it is important to work with the `UnitRegistry` everywhere in `weldx`.\n",
    "  All changes and modifications to the unit system are based and stored in this Registry (example: enabling use of `\"%\"` for units).\n",
    "2. Based on the above `UnitRegistry` the `Q_` object gets created.\n",
    "  This should be the default method when creating new quantities throughout `weldx`."
