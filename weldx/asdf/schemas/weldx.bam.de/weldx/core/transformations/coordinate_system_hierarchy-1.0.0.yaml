title: |
  Schema that describes a local coordinate system hierarchy
description: |
  It stores information how the different coordinate systems are arranged towards each other. The basic data structure
  is a tree.
type: object
properties:
  name:
    type: string

  root_system_name:
    description: |
      Name of the root coordinate system
    type: string

  reference_time:
    description: |
      A timestamp that serves as reference point for all attached coordinate systems.
    tag: "tag:weldx.bam.de:weldx/time/timestamp-1.0.0"

  subsystem_names:
    description: |
      A list containing the names of subsystems that are directly attached to the main hierarchy. Nested subsystems
      are excluded.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string

  subsystems:
    description: |
      A list containing the data of all subsystems including nested structures.
    type: array

  coordinate_systems:
    description: |
      An array of all the coordinate systems' data. This includes their name, parent system and how they are arranged
      towards their parent system.
