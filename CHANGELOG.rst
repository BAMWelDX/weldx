********************
 0.5.1 (04.11.2021)
********************

added
=====

-  `Time.duration` to get the covered duration of the data and
   `Time.resample` to get a new `Time` instance with resampled time data
   within the same boundaries as the original object `[#603]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/603>`__

-  Added `weldx.geometry.SpatialData.limits` to calculate coordinate
   boundaries. `[#604] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/604>`__

   files. `[#610] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/610>`__

changes
=======

-  All public interfaces of the `weldx.geometry` module classes now
   require the usage of units and support unit strings as inputs.
   `[#588] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/588>`__

-  `CoordinateSystemManager.time_union` now returns a `Time` instance
   instead of a pandas type `[#603]

   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/612>`__

-  Renamed the parameter ``coordinate_system_name`` of
   `CoordinateSystemManager.assign_data` to ``reference_system`` and
   added the parameter ``target_system``. If the latter one is not

********************
 0.5.0 (12.10.2021)
********************

Release ``0.5.0`` brings a major rework of the `weldx` standard and many
API improvements:

Highlights
==========

-  `weldx` now internally uses the reworked ASDF extension API. The
   schema and tag naming patterns have also changed to the recommended
   ``asdf://`` format.

-  New `Time` class to make handling of time related functionality
   easier and consistent.

-  many internal reworks to streamline the code.

-  rework the `API documentation
   <https://weldx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`__ to show the most
   important classes.

Compatibility
=============

-  the ``0.5.x`` versions will retain backwards compatibility with files
   generated with the ``0.4.x`` versions and convert them to the new
   naming schema on save. Support for the old schemas will be dropped in
   the ``0.6`` release.

added
=====

-  added "units" (exact) and "dimensionality" (dimensionality
   compatible) checking options to `util.xr_check_coords` `[#442]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/442>`__

   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/537>`__

changes
=======

-  move `welding.util.sine` utility function to `weldx.welding.util`
   `[#439] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/439>`__

-  `LocalCoordinateSystem` and `CoordinateSystemManager` function
   parameters related to time now support all types that are also
   supported by the new `Time` class `[#448]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/448>`__

-  `LocalCoordinateSystem.interp_time` returns static systems if only a
   single time value is passed or if there is no overlap between the
   interpolation time range and the coordinate systems time range. This
   also affects the results of some `CoordinateSystemManager` methods
   (`CoordinateSystemManager.get_cs` ,
   `CoordinateSystemManager.interp_time`) `[#476]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/476>`__

   all other ones into `weldx.util.util`. Content from both submodules
   can still be accessed using `weldx.util` `[#490]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/490>`__

-  xarray implementations for the `LocalCoordinateSystem` now operate on
   time as a dimension instead of coordinates `[#486]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/486>`__

-  `WeldxFile.copy` now creates a copy to a (optional) file. Before it
   just returned a dictionary `[#504]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/504>`__.

-  changed the default `pint.Unit` formatting to short notation ``:~``
   `[#519] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/519>`__. (the asdf
   serialization still uses long notation (`[#560]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/560>`__))

-  ``welding_current`` and ``welding_voltage`` in the single-pass weld
   schema now expect the tag
   ``"asdf://weldx.bam.de/weldx/tags/core/time_series-0.1.*"`` instead
   of ``"asdf://weldx.bam.de/weldx/tags/measurement/signal-0.1.*"``
   `[#578] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/578>`__.

-  ``Geometry.__init__`` now also accepts an ``iso.IsoBaseGroove`` as
   ``profile`` parameter `[#583]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/583>`__.

-  Renamed ``Geometry.__init__`` parameter ``trace`` to
   ``trace_or_length``. A `pint.Quantity` is now an accepted input. In
   this case the value will be used to create a linear trace of the
   given length `[#583] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/583>`__.

fixes
=====

-  `WeldxFile.show_asdf_header` prints output on console, before it only
   returned the header as parsed dict and string representation. Also
   tweaked efficiency by not writing binary blocks `[#459]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/459>`__, `[#469]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/469>`__.

-  Merging and unmerging multiple `CoordinateSystemManager` instances
   now correctly preserves all attached data. `[#494]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/494>`__.

-  `util.compare_nested` can compare sets `[#496]
   <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/496>`__

-  `WeldxFile` respects ``mode`` argument also for BytesIO and file
   handles `[#539] <https://github.com/BAMWelDX/weldx/pull/539>`__.

   for `LocalCoordinateSystem`: It is now possible to define a
   time-dependent `LocalCoordinateSystem` with a simple function by
   passing a `TimeSeries` object with a `MathematicalExpression` as
   ``coordinates``. For an example, click the link above.

-  `MeasurementChain
   <https://weldx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/measurement_chain.html>`__
   The `measurement.MeasurementChain` has been reworked to be easier and
