    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the `MeasurementChain` class is to describe as detailed as possible how experimental data is acquired.\n",
    "Acquiring this data is a process that usually involves multiple substeps. For example, during a temperature measurement we might have a sensor that produces a voltage correlating with the current temperature.\n",
    "Since we wanted to know the temperature and not some arbitrary voltage, we need to transform the voltage data into temperature data by utilizing the calibration of our sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MeasurementChain` is build upon 2 basic constructs: Signals and transformations. \n",
    "We always start our measurement chain with an initial signal, generated by a source sensor.\n",
    "In the example we gave before this was a voltage.\n",
    "To get to the data of interest we might need to perform one or more transformation steps were each one yields a new signal.\n",
    "Possible transformations are for example an AD conversion, signal amplification, filtering, or applying a calibration.\n",
    "The last signal of the measurement chain is usually the one we generate our measurement data from by recording its value at certain points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now discuss the different methods to construct a `MeasurementChain` and the features it offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction without additional classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to construct a measurement chain is to use the `from_parameters` and the `create_transformation` methods. With these functions, we do not need to bother with as many extra classes as with the other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the `from_parameters` function to create a new measurement chain. We need to provide 5 parameters to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the measurement chain\n",
    "- The name of the source that creates the first, unprocessed measurement signal\n",
    "- The error of the source\n",
    "- The type of the source signal (analog or digital)\n",
    "- The unit of the source signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, one can also provide the associated measurement data, if it was recorded, but we will discuss this in a later section. Let's start by creation our first measurement chain:"
