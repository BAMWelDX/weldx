    "\n",
    "Aquiring experimental data is a process that usually involves multiple substeps. For example, during a temperature measurement we might have a sensor that produces a voltage correlating with the current temperature. If the produced voltage signal is analog, we need to convert it into a digital one to process it on our computer. Since we wanted to know the temperature and not some arbitrary voltage, we also need to transform the voltage data into temperature data by utilizing the calibration of our sensor. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quality assesment for a set of experimental data is only possible if we know about the involved substeps and the possible errors they might introduce. As long as we do not have detailed documentation about the measurement procedure, only the persons involved in the experiment have this knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MeasurementChain` class introduced in this tutorial is meant to provide this kind of documentation. We will discuss the different methods to construct a `MeasurementChain` and the features it offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction without additional classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to construct a measurement chain is to use the `from_parameters` and the `create_transformation` methods. With these functions, we do not need to bother with as many extra classes as with the other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the `from_parameters` function to create a new measurement chain. We need to provide 5 parameters to it:\n",

    "- The name of the measurement chain\n",
    "- The name of the source that creates the first, unprocessed measurement signal\n",
    "- The error of the source\n",
    "- The type of the source signal (analog or digital)\n",
    "- The unit of the source signal\n",

Since the parameters of our function already contain the unit conversion we do not need to provide the `output_signal_unit` parameter. However, we could do this to assure that our output signal has the correct dimensionality. In case the function yields a unit of different dimensionality than passed `output_signal_unit`, an exception would be raised. Be aware, that degrees in Celsius have the same dimensionality (temperature) as Kelvin. So in this case, `create_transformation` wouldn't complain. Additionally, you can't use the `output_signal_unit` parameter to add a unit conversion if the passed function does not contain one. In fact, if only `output_signal_unit` is provided without a function, like in the AD conversion we added before, `create_transformation` generates a corresponding conversion function internally.\n",
