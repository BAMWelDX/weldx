The first 3 are the points. The fourth one is a bool which defines the winding order of the arc. If it is set to `True` the arc connects the start point to the end point using an counter clockwise arc. Otherwise both points are connected with a clockwise arc segment.

    "\n",
    "It might happen that lines and arcs are not enough to sufficiently describe a certain shape or profile. For this reason it is possible to define custom segment types. A segment which is useable with the `Shape` and `Profile` classes is a python class that needs at least a `rasterize` method and a `point_start` and `point_end` property. However, you want to use the Shapes transformation functions, you also need to define the segments `translate`, `transform`, `apply_translation` and `apply_transformation` functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a small example, we will create a sinusoidal wave segment. It should generate a sinusoidal wave in normal direction to the line from the segments start to its end. Since the start and end points must be included in the segments shape (otherwise we get visual gaps during rasterization) we can only use waves with wave lengths $N\\pi$, were $N$ is the number half waves. Additionally we will add the option to vary the waves amplitude. The constructor of the class looks as follows:\n",

    "The points are stored as columns in a 2x2 matrix. Instead of storing the amplitude value itself, the normal to the vector `point_start`->`point_end` is calculated. Its length is adjusted so that it is equal to the amplitude. We call this vector `_amplitude_vector` and store it.\n",
